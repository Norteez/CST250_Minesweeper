# CST250 Minesweeper 🎮

This repository contains my **Milestone 1 project** for **CST-250: Programming in C# II** at Grand Canyon University.  
It demonstrates a **multi-layer architecture** and clean **object-oriented design** through a console-based Minesweeper game.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

- Built using C# (.NET 8)
- Includes a **Class Library** for business logic and models
- Console app displays two Minesweeper boards (10×10 and 15×15)
- Demonstrates **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, and **separation of concerns**

## 🧮 Output Example

When run, the console prints two fully generated Minesweeper boards:

Hello, welcome to Minesweeper
Here is the answer key for the first board
...
Here is the answer key for the second board
...

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- N-Layer Application Design
- Test-Driven Development (xUnit ready)
- Randomized grid generation and logic separation
